react-marquee
==========

This is a sample `Marquee` component that can be used in React project.
The code is the result from asking `OpenAI` [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) to make a `marquee` component.

In the early days of the web, there is a `<marquee>` HTML element that is used to display scrolling text like in neon signs. Well, let's bring back the good ole days.

Please use responsively :)

# Motivation

This is basically an exercise not of `React` but using `ChatGPT` effectively.
I do not share some people's apprehension about it.
I think it complements the work of the programmer to be more efficient and productive.
As the exchange shown below illustrates, in order for the user to use `ChatGPT` effectively specially in relation to code generated, they should have a firm grasp of the basics so that they can pinpoint errors and make appropriate adjustments.



# Setup

Clone the repository, install the dependencies and run
